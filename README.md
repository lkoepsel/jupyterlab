# JupyterLab Learning Example
Uses Python, JupyterLab and git as examples to learn how to use the tools in classwork.

## Installation
1. Use the green code button above to get the link to the code.
1. Make sure HTTPS is underlined in red.
2. Click on the two boxes at the end of the "*https:...*" line.
3. Open *Git Bash* (Windows) or *Terminal* (macOS). **From here on, the application window will be called the command line interface (CLI).** 
4. In Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS), go to a base folder of your choice, such as "*My Documents*" or "*Documents*" and drag the icon of the folder to your CLI. This is an easy way to open that folder in the CLI.
5. In the CLI, type "*pwd*" to ensure you are in the right folder, it needs to end with "*My Documents*" or "*Documents*".
6. In the CLI, enter "clone " (make sure there is a space after the "e"), and *paste* the contents from step 2 above.
7. The line will look something like this (see below) and press return.
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/lkoepsel/jupyterlab.git
	```
9. Hit return, this will create a new folder called "*jupyterlab*" on your computer.
10. Use the application *jupyterlab* to open the folder.
